What is type
Easy way to refer to the different properties + fuctions that a value has


----
Type |Vlue that have this type |
string | "hi there", "", "Today is monday"
number | .000256, -20, 400000
boolean | true, false
Date | new Date()
Todo | {id: 1, completed: true, title: "Trash"} 


Types:
- Primitive Types: number, string, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbols, null
- Object Types: functions, arrays, classes, objects


Type annotations + Type interface for 
Variables
functions
objects

Type annotations: To tell type what it is related to (We developer tell Typescript the type)
Type inferance: Typescript guesses the type
